## 🎯 Objectives
- Design tamper-proof systems for real-time crash data
- Use blockchain to log immutable crash events
- Apply SHAP, LIME, and attention models for explainable crash prediction
- Simulate adversarial attacks on transportation networks
- Build edge AI models that preserve privacy using federated learning
